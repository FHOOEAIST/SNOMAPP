scoring.text=A lower score indicates a greater similarity between APPC sequence and SNOMED sequence. The score represents a weighted sum of all applied scoring algorithms. If the scoring algorithms are also applied on all SNOMED synonyms, then the score represents the average score of all synonyms. By default, the algorithms are also applied on all synonyms.
